      Each year since 1962, a group of volunteers now known as Performing Arts
      for Cyprus Charities (PACC) arrange, manage and act in a performance of a
      Shakespearean play.   The annual production is staged each June at Ancient
      Kourion Amphitheatre in Episkopi, Cyprus with all proceeds going to chosen
      Cyprus based Charities.
